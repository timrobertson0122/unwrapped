Part One - Github Challenge

This runs as a Ruby script in the shell - `ruby whats-my-language.rb`, found in the `github` folder

- Opted to use RestClient as it provided a simple syntax and easy error handling.
- All errors are captured, with a custom error message provided when an associated github user was not found.
- Script collects all of the user's repos, strips out the language data of each one and then uses Ruby's Array methods to return the first language of the highest count.

- Used percentage width to enable the container to act responsively.
- Cropped icon from image provided.
